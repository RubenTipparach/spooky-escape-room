🛠 Notes:

- Models are scaled and exported for game engine compatibility
- Pivot points are clean for animation/scripting
- FBX format works with Unity, Unreal Engine, Godot, etc.
- Textures are AI-assisted, hand-cleaned for cohesion
- 🖼️ **Textures are designed to be viewed using POINT (no filtering) mode.**  
  For the best retro look, avoid Bilinear/Trilinear filtering.
